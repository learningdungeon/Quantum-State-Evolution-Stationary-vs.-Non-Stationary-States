# Quantum-State-Evolution-Stationary-vs.-Non-Stationary-States
Fundamental difference between stationary and non-stationary quantum states through simulation using the Qiskit SDK. By simulating the time evolution of a qubit under a Hamiltonian, we observe how the measurement probabilities of a stationary state remain constant, while those of a non-stationary state oscillate over time.
